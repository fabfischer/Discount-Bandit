# Discount Bandit (fork of [Discount Bandit](https://github.com/Cybrarist/Discount-Bandit)
Discount bandit is a price tracker across multiple stores, where you can track the price across all of them.

You can also be notified when an item reaches your desired price, so you don't have to check each store every day.
